          Currently, TS4NFDI is in the initialization phase with the following goals:
          to create a comprehensive overview of all consortia and the terminologies and
          related services in use â€“ as well as their requirements and relevant use cases.
          Based on the development of a detailed architecture, a first pilot should at least
          integrate three different terminology service platforms into an aligned terminology
          service backend.
